Compile time polymorphism:

Polymorphism that is resolved during compiler time is known as static polymorphism. Method overloading is an example of compile time polymorphism.



Run time polymorphism:

Dynamic polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime, thats why it is called runtime polymorphism
