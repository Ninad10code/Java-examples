Encapsulation simply means binding object state(fields) and behaviour(methods) together. 

If you are creating class, you are doing encapsulation.
The whole idea behind encapsulation is to hide the implementation details from users. 

If a data member is private it means it can only be accessed within the same class. 

No outside class can access private data member (variable) of other class.
