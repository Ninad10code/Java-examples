The process by which one class acquires the properties(data members) and functionalities(methods) of another class is called inheritance. 
The aim of inheritance is to provide the reusability of code so that a class has to write only the unique features and rest of the common properties and functionalities can be extended from the another class.



ADVANTAGE:
The biggest advantage of Inheritance is that the code that is already present in base class need not be rewritten in the child class.
